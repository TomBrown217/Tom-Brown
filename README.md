my code is supposed to create context simplifier where you paste the part of the text you want to make shorter with simpler vocabulary to make it easier to understand and read and then press the green rectangular button which will then output the simplified text into another box.

this is for gov.uk which can help people understand the long and complicated text it can sometimes have.
